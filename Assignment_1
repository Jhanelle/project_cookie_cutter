#dcoumentary files for a computational project

mkdir project
cd project
touch License.md
echo "Transportation_of_contaminants" > Readme.md

#The above commands are used to control of the root directory.
#The project is the root directory for this case.
#The touch command creates a the blank document License.md
#The echo command is used to write into a new file which in this case a a Readme format

mkdir data
mkdir results
mkdir bin

#The code mkdir makes 3 directories as seen above

cd data
echo "Raw results from experiment"> Readme.md
cd ../

#This code craetes a text file in the data directory
#These also create a Readme for the data directory

cd results
echo "Graphs tabulated from raw results"> Readme.md
cd ../

#This code creates a text file the results directory
#These also create a Readme for the data directory

cd bin
echo "Summary of the results"> Readme.md
